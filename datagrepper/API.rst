Prerequisites
-------------

If you've never interacted with a JSON API before, you should
check out the handy command-line tool `HTTPie
<https://github.com/jkbr/httpie#httpie-a-cli-curl-like-tool-for-humans>`_.
All our examples here will use it.

To install it on Fedora run ``$ sudo yum -y install httpie``.

If you get stuck here, feel free to drop into the ``#fedora-apps``
channel on `freenode <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_use_IRC>`_ to
ask questions or give us a high five if everything goes well.
